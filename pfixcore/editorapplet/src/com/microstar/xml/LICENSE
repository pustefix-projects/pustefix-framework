It was a bit hard to come up with some facts regarding the exact license
terms of the com.microstar.xml package. The XML parser is known
as Ælfred, which is also used (in a modified and advanced form) in
Saxon.  Ælfred was originally developed by David Megginson at
Microstar (which no longer exists), and placed more or less in the
public domain. Many other free projects use this code, too.

According to saxons website, the following original copyright/license applies:
