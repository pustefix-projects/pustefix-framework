    <section xml:id="news.0_15_6.modules">
      <title>Module enhancements</title>
      <para>
        Introduced pre-defined special module names <literal>WEBAPP</literal> and 
        <literal>PAGEDEF</literal>, which can be set as <literal>module</literal> values at <literal>&lt;pfx:include&gt;</literal>
        and <literal>&lt;pfx:image&gt;</literal> tags to explicitly refer to resources from the webapp folder
        or resources from within the module where a page is defined (see <xref linkend="advanced.dyninclude.modinclude.special"/>).
      </para>
      <para>
        The config-include mechanism now supports directly referencing config
        fragment files from modules by adding a <literal>module</literal> attribute to the according
        <literal>&lt;config-include&gt;</literal> elements (see <xref linkend="configuration.depend"/> and <xref linkend="configuration.servlet.contextxml"/>).

    <section xml:id="news.0_15_7.modules">
      <title>Module enhancements</title>
      <para>
        Static web resources now can be delivered directly from modules without having to extract them to the webapp folder first
        by the build process. Thus it's no longer necessary to define resource mappings in the module's descriptor file (see
        <xref linkend="modulessupport"/>). Making
        resources from modules publicly available now just requires to define an according static path in the project configuration,
        e.g. <literal>&lt;path&gt;/modules/mymodule/mypath/img&lt;/path&gt;</literal> makes available the according folder 
        <literal>/PUSTEFIX-INF/mypath/img</literal> from the module/JAR file <literal>mymodule</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Status message files no longer require to be extracted using a resource mapping. 
        Now they're automatically detected within module jars
        and merged to the according <literal>modules-override</literal> folder.

    <section xml:id="news.0_15_11.config">
      <title>Configuration system enhancements</title>
      <para>
        We improved the configuration customization support by making context init parameters available as environment properties
        and thus usable as XPath variables during the customization process (see <xref linkend="configuration.customization"/>).
      </para>
      <para>
        Besides we dropped the storage of environment properties during the build (and the reusage at runtime). Thus a WAR file
        doesn't contain build-dependent settings any longer and can be used in different environments. Environment specific
        config customizations can be controlled by setting according context init parameters.

    <section xml:id="news.0_15_13.config">
      <title>Module/configuration enhancements</title>
      <para>
        Including configuration fragments from modules now can be done without having to directly specify the module names.
        Therefor the <literal>config-include</literal> element now supports <literal>module</literal> attribute values
        containing simple patterns, which will be matched against the names of the modules available in the classpath,
        e.g. <literal>module="*"</literal> will include all according configuration fragments found in the classpath,
        <literal>module="*-us"</literal> will include only fragments from modules whose name ends with <literal>-us</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Added support for conditional unpacking of module resources.
        Within the module descriptor you can set the optional <literal>resources</literal> element's 
        attribute <literal>unpack</literal> to <literal>obsolete</literal>. Thus the resources won't be extracted
	in the current or newer Pustefix versions (despite containing resource mappings).
        If you still want that obsolete resources are extracted, you can configure the Maven <literal>pustefix-webapp-plugin</literal>
	by adding <literal>&lt;unpackObsolete&gt;true&lt;/unpackObsolete&gt;</literal> to its configuration.
	This should help migrating modules and applications towards avoiding extracting resources at all, while keeping
        backwards compatibility for modules shared between different applications (see <xref linkend="modulessupport"/>).

    <section xml:id="news.0_15_13.tooling">
      <title>Tooling enhancements</title>
      <para>
        When hovering the closing include part delimiters displayed in edit mode, the tooltip now shows additional information for dynamic
        includes. It prints out the complete dynamic search chain, e.g. something like 
        <literal>webapp(?) module-a(-) module-aa(+) module-ab(+)</literal>, whereas <literal>(?)</literal> means that the file doesn't
        exist, <literal>(-)</literal> says that the file exists but doesn't contain the part, and <literal>(+)</literal> implies 
        that a file containing the part is found.
      </para>
      <para>
        Introduced the Pustefix internals page. Similar to the DOM tree view this page provides some additional information useful
        during development, e.g. environment, JVM and module information (see <xref linkend="tooling.pfxinternals"/>).

    <title>What's new in Pustefix 0.16.5</title>
  
    <para>Pustefix 0.16.5 brings some CMS improvements. The CMS editor now supports editing of resources coming from modules
          (if they're loaded via the live mechanism). Modules are readonly by default, but can be made editable by adding
          <literal>&lt;content-editable&gt;true&lt;/content-editable&gt;</literal> to the module descriptor 
          (see <xref linkend="modulessupport.types.new"/>).

  <section xml:id="news.0_17_0">
    <title>What's new in Pustefix 0.17.0</title>
  
    <para>Pustefix 0.17.0 focuses on XSLT rendering improvements. It brings the so-called render extensions, a mechanism which allows
          to call an extension function to produce additional output and write it to the result of the main transformation (on the last
          transformation level).
    </para>
    <para>The default render extension implementation, the so-called render include mechanism, supports the standalone rendering/outputting of 
        include parts.
        Thus you're able to include parts at runtime, e.g. based on the data from the result tree. In contrast to the traditional runtime
        includes, which are restricted to simple content and a subset of tags available on the last transformation level, the render includes support     
        arbitrary content because the metatags and master XSLT transformations are also applied (see <xref linkend="xslt.renderextensions"/>).
    </para>
    <para>
        Render include parts not just can be rendered within a regular main transformation, but can be also rendered standalone, i.e. you can 
        request a rendered part via AJAX to dynamically update your page. 
    </para>

  <section xml:id="news.0_18_0">
    <title>What's new in Pustefix 0.18.0</title>
  
    <para>Pustefix 0.18.0 focuses on new internationalization features. It brings multi-tenancy on the view layer, supporting
          different views for different tenants (like countries or markets) within a single application instance, along with
	  runtime-switchable multi-language support, including internationalized page names.
    </para>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.multitenancy">
      <title>Multi-tenancy</title>
      <para>
        Pustefix 0.18 provides multi-tenancy support on the view layer, i.e. it can create and deliver alternative versions of a page
        depending on a selected tenant. Tenants are automatically selected by matching host name patterns against the requested
        host name. Alternative page versions are created by applying filters to the dynamic include mechanism, thus overriding
        and extending the core page content with tenant- and/or language-specific content from according tenant/language modules
        (see <xref linkend="advanced.multitenancy"/>).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.multilanguage">
      <title>Multi-language</title>
      <para>
        Up to Pustefix 0.17 the only way to make the language of your application switchable at runtime was using
        the <literal>&lt;pfx:langselect&gt;</literal> tags to directly embed all language dependent content into the same
        part and theme side by side. With Pustefix 0.18 it's possible to automatically create different versions of a page serving
        different languages using the dynamic override mechanism, e.g. you can source out all language dependent content
        into own modules (language packs) which override a language independent core module (see <xref linkend="advanced.i18n"/>).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.sitemap">
      <title>Sitemap and i18n pagenames</title>
      <para>
        Pustefix 0.18 differentiates between logical page names and display page names. Thus you can rename pages or provide
        internationalized page names without having to change existing page references (to the logical page name). Such page aliases
        are configured in a file called <literal>sitemap.xml</literal> which is replacing the <literal>navigation</literal> configuration
        from <literal>depend.xml</literal> (see <xref linkend="configuration.sitemap"/>).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.pagealt">
      <title>Page alternatives</title>
      <para>
        Page alternatives are a new concept for creating different representations of a page (including possible variants). Page
        alternatives are internally used to create different versions for languages/tenants, but can be also used for
        pages which are based on a common page, assigned to the same logical page, but with different content and display pagename, e.g.
        landing pages (see <xref linkend="advanced.pagealternatives"/>).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.modules">
      <title>Pustefix modules</title>
      <para>
        The module mechanism has been extended to support sourcing out every kind of resource into modules, e.g. you
        can put arbitrary configuration files into modules (like <literal>project.xml</literal>, <literal>depend.xml</literal> or
        <literal>spring.xml</literal>). The Pustefix resource loading mechanism has been extended and now additionally 
        implements Spring's Resource abstraction layer. Thus you can use module URIs within the Spring configuration, e.g.
        for injecting module resources into beans.
      </para>
      <para>
        The dynamic search mechanism now supports adding modules to the default search chain. This is declaratively done
        in the module descriptor <literal>pustefix-module.xml</literal>. You can additionally set a search priority to define
        a search order. Using filter attributes you can define a dynamic search filter allowing to include/exclude certain
        modules from searching/overriding, which is useful for multi-tenant/language applications to filter by tenant or language
        (see <xref linkend="modulessupport.types.new"/>).
      </para>

    <section xml:id="news.0_18_0.autoconfig">
      <title>Automatic configuration</title>
      <para>
        Pustefix 0.18 extends the <literal>depend.xml</literal> configuration by providing a <literal>&lt;auto-standardpage&gt;</literal>
        element which can be used as template, which automatically creates standardpage definitions for pages found in a specified
        folder (see <xref linkend="configuration.depend.autostandardpage"/>).

      <para>
        The default error page for XSLT errors now provides additional contextual information. The error line from the XML file causing the

        In prior versions the XSLT tooling extensions (dynamic include information, console, etc.) were always enabled if not running
        in production mode. Now you can selectively enable/disable the tooling extensions in all modes (except production mode). Therefore
        Pustefix introduced the configuration element <literal>&lt;tooling-extensions&gt;</literal> (see 
        <xref linkend="configuration.project.projectxml"/>).
      </para>
      <para>
        Besides the XSLT tooling has been decoupled from the editor settings, i.e. you can use the include information tooling without
        having the editor enabled.

      <title>Object-to-XML mapping with JAXB</title>
      <para>
        Pustefix's object-to-XML mapping layer now alternatively supports marshalling via JAXB, e.g. <literal>ContextResources</literal> annotated with the according JAXB annotation 
        now are automatically serialized to the DOM tree via <literal>JAXB</literal> instead of the builtin serialization mechanism (see <xref linkend="advanced.object2xml.jaxb"/>).

      <title>TargetGenerator tooling extensions toggle</title>
      <para>
        Pustefix now supports toggling of the XSL tooling extensions at runtime. Thus you can generate pages in development mode being fully identical with the production version, which
        can be very helpful if you're debugging problems caused by the additional markup from the XSL tooling (like whitespace differences). The toggle can be found as action on the
        Pustefix internals page (see <xref linkend="tooling.pfxinternals"/>).
